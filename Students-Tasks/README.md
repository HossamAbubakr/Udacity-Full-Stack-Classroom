## Udacity Hub Student Activity Archive

### 📖 Overview

This folder contains some of the tasks done by our students.

The students activities fall into three categories

- In session
- After session
- Students leadership

In this archive we are collecting and celebrating the achievements of mostly the last 2 types of activities.

### 🙋‍♂️ Activities

For the task based system we have two main take-home/after session activities.

#### 🤝 Research Collab

Starting with session 1 and through session 3 we have an activity called **Research Collab** where students can work together to finish a research on a specific topic.

On session 1 the students are given a specific topic but they are free to vote for their own topics to research through session 2 and 3.

#### 🤜🤛 Tech Brawl

Picking up from where we left off and starting with session 4 through the end of the cohort, I introduce **Tech Brawls**.

The complexity level of the tasks increases as we go into a more competitive and a more practical task based system.

And to be inclusive of those who favor doing research. Tech Brawls are split into two parts:

- **Theoretical :** Where you are assigned a research topic

- **Practical:** Where you are assigned a practical task

And the students are free to choose one, the other or both forms of task each week.

## 🧱 Set-up
