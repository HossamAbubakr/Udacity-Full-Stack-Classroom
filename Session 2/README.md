# Session 2

## 📖 Overview

In today's session, we learned how to create and initialize a TypeScript project from scratch.

We learned how to set up our TypeScript configuration file and prepare our project for transpilation.

We then added eslint and prettier to our project and learned how to connect them together to work with a single script.

We finally learned how to configure eslint and prettier with our custom rules.

For this week's bonus content we learned about backend development essentials!
