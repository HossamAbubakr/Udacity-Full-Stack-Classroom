# Session 9

## üìñ Overview

In Today's session we started our practical journey where we took a deep dive into Elastic Beanstalk.

We started by learning about some essential AWS services and their usage.

Then we learned how to set-up our application and configure it in a meaningful way to get it ready for deployment.

Lastly we successfully deployed our application and fixed all the common issues along the way especially those re-occurring 502 errors!

As a bonus we learned some essentials regarding CI/CD in preparation for our next session.
