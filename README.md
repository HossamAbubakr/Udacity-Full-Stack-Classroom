## üí° About

This repo includes the live coding portion of my lectures for Udacity Full-Stack Javascript Nanodegree students.

We are building a backend application called **Udacity Hub** which functions as a hub for Udacity students and session leads.

In each session, I apply the Nanodegree topics to our application.

Starting from an empty project to a complete application that's deployable to AWS and utilizes CI/CD powered by CircleCI.

This repo will be continuously updated, improved, and iterated upon.

Each session includes a project folder, a list of additional learning resources, a breakdown of the session content, and a quiz.

Each folder contains an extensive list of commits that breaks each session into digestible chunks that are easy to follow.

## ‚õî Disclaimer

Please **DO NOT COPY** any of the code included in this repo into your project submission or you might face a plagiarism case.

The purpose of this repo is to serve as a reference for your self-study after our sessions.

Please don't misuse the code provided as a way to skip finishing your projects.

## üß± Prerequisites

Before attempting to start the program you should be familiar with the following topics.

- [JavaScript Essentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c)
- [Backend Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBu54nfzxAQ)
- [Express Essentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L72fhGm1tfE)
- [SQL Essentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWeW3sCmD2k)

So please click on the provided links to fill in the gaps in your knowledge.

## üöÄ Goals

By the end of session 10 you will be able to:

- Utilize some of the best features of TypeScript.
- Build comprehensive backend applications.
- Create complex and efficient SQL relationships.
- Retrieve data from SQL using Joins.
- Implement authentication / authorization.
- Implement password hashing, salting, and peppering.
- Create an extensive set of unit tests.
- Create and configure several cloud services.
- Set up and deploy our completed app to the cloud.
- Create a CI/CD pipeline to automate our deployment.

## üíª Setup

Each folder functions as its own isolated and self-contained unit.
Meaning that you have to set up each folder individually.

To install the required packages please use

```
npm install
```

Inside the designated **udacity_hub** folder _NOT_ the session folder.

Some of the sessions include unit tests which can be executed using

```
npm run test
```

And starting from session 5 a set of migrations can be executed using

```
npx db-migrate X
```

With X being substituted with **up**, **down** or **reset**.

Starting from _Session 4_, a database will be needed

To create a database through **psql** please use

```
CREATE DATABASE DB_NAME;
```

### üåü Special Folders

Some sessions include special or additional data files such as **SQL_REFERENCE.sql** starting from _Session 4_ which includes the SQL commands used in the live session.

Or the **data_migrations** folder starting from _Session 6_ which includes a set of data to be used on your database to add some mock data. And the instructions on how to utilize it are included in the [README](/Session%206/README.md#-notes)

### üî£ Environment Variables

Starting from _Session 5_ env files are used to pass important information so please check the **ENV-EXAMPLE** file in each session you want to run.

## üñê Questions

If you have any questions, ideas, or suggestions please head over to our [discussions board](https://github.com/HossamAbubakr/Udacity-Full-Stack-Classroom/discussions) where I will do my best to implement your ideas and answer your questions.

## üéâ Contributions

Your contributions are welcome! Whether to:

- Report a bug
- Discuss the state of the code
- Submit a fix
- Propose new features
- Comment on a commit to explain it further.

Our [community](https://github.com/HossamAbubakr/Udacity-Full-Stack-Classroom/discussions) is also open for any of your ideas and questions.

Please note that we have a few self-imposed restrictions

- The changes need to fall under the content of the Nanodegree
- We can't use a different database system or use an ORM
- Change the application structure drastically.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

- Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- Ensure the test suite passes.
- Make sure your code lints.
- Issue that pull request!
